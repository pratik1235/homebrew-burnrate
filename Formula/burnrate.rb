  # compiled with -headerpad_max_install_names. This avoids MachO::HeaderPadError
  # during the fix_dynamic_linkage step that occurs when the pre-built wheel's
  # @rpath dylib ID lacks enough header padding to be rewritten to the full
  # absolute install path. :no_linkage stops Homebrew from symlinking them into
  # /opt/homebrew/lib, keeping them isolated inside their own keg.

    # Homebrew's fix_dynamic_linkage rewrites @rpath load commands to
    # absolute Cellar paths *after* the original linker-signed adhoc
    # code signature was created.  This invalidates the page hashes
    # embedded in the signature.  On ARM64 macOS with SIP the kernel
    # validates page hashes on first load and kills the process with
    # SIGKILL (Code Signature Invalid / Invalid Page) if they don't
    # match.  The crash typically manifests only on *other* machines
    # (or after a reboot) because the installing machine still has
    # the pages cached.
    #
    # Signing with `codesign --force --sign -` replaces the stale
    # linker-signed signature with a fresh adhoc signature that has
    # correct page hashes for the modified binary.
