  # cryptography, pydantic (which bundles pydantic-core + jiter) are declared as
  # Homebrew formula dependencies so Homebrew installs them with bottles that were
  # compiled with -headerpad_max_install_names. This avoids MachO::HeaderPadError
  # during the fix_dynamic_linkage step that occurs when the pre-built wheel's
  # @rpath dylib ID lacks enough header padding to be rewritten to the full
  # absolute install path. :no_linkage stops Homebrew from symlinking them into
  # /opt/homebrew/lib, keeping them isolated inside their own keg.
